    git remote add origin <remote git>
    yo node-bahmutov

Answer a few questions and you should be all set.

## Features

* Default `.npmrc` and `.gitignore` files
* Git hooks and message validation using [pre-git](https://github.com/bahmutov/pre-git)
* Linting and auto formatting using [standard](http://standardjs.com/) and
  [prettier-standard](https://github.com/sheerun/prettier-standard#readme) using `npm run lint`
* Linting against data mutations using
  [eslint-plugin-immutable](https://github.com/jhusain/eslint-plugin-immutable#readme)
  (optional)
* Showing open Git issues via
  [git-issues](https://github.com/softwarescales/git-issues) using `npm run issues`
* Unit testing with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) using `npm run unit`
* Packaged [size reporting on pre-push hook][size] using `npm run size`
* Running [Node Security Project](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) check on `pre-push`
* Checking if you are trying to commit
  [sensitive files](https://github.com/bahmutov/ban-sensitive-files)

* License check of production dependencies with
  [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker) using `npm run license`
* Outdated, missing local and unused dependencies check with
  [deps-ok](https://github.com/bahmutov/deps-ok) and
  [dependency-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dependency-check)
  using `npm run deps` and `npm run unused-deps`
* Docker file generation with `yo node-bahmutov:docker` ([optional](#generating-dockerfile))

## Alias

It is hard to remember `yo node-bahmutov` command, so I suggest using an
alias to start a good NPM module. Run this command or place it in your
`~/.alias` file

```
# create new NPM module using Yeoman generator-node-bahmutov
alias new_module='yo node-bahmutov && yo node-bahmutov:release'
```

Make a folder, init new Git repo, set remote GitHub origin url and then call
the alias

```shell
$ new_module
```

Answer 3 questions and you will be all set!

## Recommended

### Semantic release for GitHub

I recommend installing [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
right away after bootstrapping the project, it will work nicely with the commit message format.
We already include the semantic release badge in the generated README file, so you have no
excuse

    npm i -g semantic-release-cli
    semantic-release-cli setup

Add version back into `package.json`, I recommend

    "version": "0.0.0-semantic-release"

### Semantic release for GitLab

If you use GitLab, you should take a look at
[semantic-release-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/semantic-release-gitlab)

## Generating Dockerfile

You can generate a Dockerfile with good defaults for running the current
Node project inside a docker container. Based on
[Docker file in this gist](https://gist.github.com/bahmutov/1003fa86980dda147ff6).

    yo node-bahmutov:docker

This generator also adds `docker-*` commands to the `package.json` to build
the image, run and stop the container.

### Generated docker image features

* Runs Node application as a dedicated user (for security) with production
  environment set
* Exposes port 1337 and sets the image environment variable `PORT`
* Uses [Yelp/dumb-init](https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init) as default
  PID 1 process

You can see the full [Dockerfile](docker/templates/Dockerfile) template.

## Semantic release

You can setup [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
and include useful plugins like
[simple-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/simple-commit-message)
and [dont-crack](https://github.com/bahmutov/dont-crack)
by running

    yo node-bahmutov:release

Assumes you have global `semantic-release-cli` tool already preset, if not

    npm install --global semantic-release-cli

## Test

Change into an empty folder, for example

    cd /tmp
    mkdir test-generator
    cd test-generator
    yo node-bahmutov

Or just run `npm run e2e` (assumes global `yo` install). The go into the
folder `/tmp/test-node-generator` and run the project. You can even
build the Docker image and try running the project inside the container.

## Debugging

Run the generator with environment variable DEBUG set to "gen"

    DEBUG=gen yo node-bahmutov

## Development

Following [the instructions](http://yeoman.io/authoring/index.html).
This module also reads answers to user questions from file `answers.json`
if found in the current working directory. An example file is
[test/answers.json](test/answers.json).

## Remote

This generator assumes there is already a remote Git
(probably GitHub or GitLab) repository where all code will live. Please create
it first and then set it before running generator

    git init
    git remote add origin <remote git>
